## Description

Our client has asked to view a a deployed portfolio of my work samples, so that they can review and asses them for potential employment.

# Purpose

Having a porfolio, enhances who you are a candidate. It helps you stand out from other aplicants and showcase your strengths. 

It allows you to present yourself in a creative way and show potential employers your capabilities! 
## Process

 In order to create a porfolio. I created an HTML Skelton.
 
 I like to start from top to bottom so I first created a nav bar in my html in order for the employer to have scrolling-acessibilty in the web page. 

 I created sections for my content that include an About me, Portfolio and and Contact section. 

 I styled my portfolio using flexbox in the nav section and used a css grid style in my projects so my website is responsive and can be seen with other mobile devices. 

 I also applied border styles and played with colors in the css to be more presentable!


## Conclusion

This portfolio project illustrated how important it is for devolopers to be able to showcase their strengths through a portfolio.

There are countless ways Css can design your web page. One error of css can mess up your entire page. So this project has taught me to watch out for random bracks or even a comma that could break my web

This has also taught me the importance a responsive web layout that can be viewed mobile or on other screens


This project has allowed me to become more familiar with HTML format and helped me visualize my work with css. I appreciate this project for helping me grow as a junior devoloper.
